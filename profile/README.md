## We Provide HIPAA-compliant Data ETL as a Service

The Dart Data Nexus saves months of software development time and expense accommodating antiquated transmission formats, flat files, and HIPAA-compliant data security standards for personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI).

Our instantly deployable SaaS solution allows your teams to move out of the 20th century and start moving at full speed. 


## We Raise the Speed Limit on Innovation

We engineered a secure, HIPAA-compliant data processing solution designed specifically for the employer health and benefits market. 

The Dart Data Nexus receives data in a variety of formats—from flat files to API data streams—rationalizes it into a standardized data model, and passes it on to downstream systems in the format best suited to their needs. We remove the barriers to entry and take the pain out of supporting multiple data sources so you can focus on what makes your business compete.

**Our smart processing system securely aggregates data and identifies real people** across their many roles as employee, patient, or insured, and it gives you one view of all of their activities within the ecosystem so you can meet their needs. We can also gather data at the aggregate population level to aid in analytics and service improvement recommendations.

Since the Dart Health Data Nexus is an enterprise SaaS solution, your costs are manageable and predictable, even as your business scales.
